/*
Instructions:
Some really funny web dev gave you a sequence of numbers from his API response as an sequence of strings!

You need to cast the whole array to the correct type.

Create the function that takes as a parameter a sequence of numbers represented as strings and outputs a sequence of numbers.

ie:["1", "2", "3"] to [1, 2, 3]

Note that you can receive floats as well.
*/

// Solution:
const toNumberArray = (stringarray) => stringarray.map(Number)

/*
Best rated solutions:

function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  return stringarray.map(parseFloat);
}

function toNumberArray(stringarray){
  return stringarray.map(e => +e);
}
