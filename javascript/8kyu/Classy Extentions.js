/*
Instructions:
The goal of this kata is to train the basic OOP concepts of inheritance and method overriding.
You will be preloaded with the Animal class, so you should only edit the Cat class.

Task
Your task is to complete the Cat class which extends Animal and replace the speak method to return the cats name + meows. e.g. 'Mr Whiskers meows.'

The name attribute is accessible in the class with this.name.
*/

// Solution:
class Cat extends Animal {
  speak() {
    return `${this.name} meows.`
  }
}

/*
Best rated solutions:
