/*
Instructions:
Given a non-negative integer b, write a function which returns an integer d such that the binary representation of b is the same as the decimal representation of d.

Examples:

n = 1 should return 1
n = 5 should return 101
n = 11 should return 1011
*/

// Solution:
const toBinary = n => Number(n.toString(2));

/*
Best rated solutions:

let toBinary = n => +n.toString(2)
