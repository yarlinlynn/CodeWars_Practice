Instructions:
Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.
*/

// Solution:
function correct(string) {
  if (string.includes('5')) string = string.replaceAll('5', 'S');
  
  if(string.includes('0')) string = string.replaceAll('0', 'O');
  
  if(string.includes('1')) string = string.replaceAll('1', 'I');
  
  return string
}

Best rated solutions:

correct = s => s.replace(/0/g,'O').replace(/1/g,'I').replace(/5/g,'S')

const corrections = {
	'5': 'S',
	'0': 'O',
    '1': 'I',
};
const correct = string => (
	string.replace(/[501]/g, character => corrections[character])
);

function correct(string) {
    return string.replace(/0/g, "O")
                 .replace(/5/g, "S")
                 .replace(/1/g, "I");
