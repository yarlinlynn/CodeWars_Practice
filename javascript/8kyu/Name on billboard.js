Instructions:
You can print your name on a billboard ad. Find out how much it will cost you. Each character has a default price of £30, but that can be different if you are given 2 parameters instead of 1 (always 2 for Java).

You can not use multiplier "*" operator.

If your name would be Jeong-Ho Aristotelis, ad would cost £600. 20 letters * 30 = 600 (Space counts as a character).
*/

// Solution:
function billboard(name, price = 30){
  let cost = 0;
   for(let i = 0; i < name.length; i++) {
     cost += price;
   }
  
  return cost;
}

Best rated solutions:

function billboard(name, price = 30) {
  return name.split('').reduce((sum, letter) => sum + price, 0); 
}

function billboard(name, price = 30){
  return name.repeat(price).length;
}
